# Email Classification using NLP

This repository demonstrates email spam classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It employs `CountVectorizer`, `Multinomial Naive Bayes`, and a `Pipeline` for efficient workflows.

## Features
- Preprocess email text with `CountVectorizer`.
- Train and evaluate a `Multinomial Naive Bayes` model.
- Use a `Pipeline` for streamlined operations.
- Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/umair801/Spam_Email_Classifier.git
